### RPG Idea
#### Class-based combat game
My idea is to have a class selection based small combat game in which you can fight with a few different classes of fighter. the point of having class selection is to have unique battles with different items and weapons. My insparation has been games such as War Thunder and team fortress 2, both of these games have a complex system of different fighters the player can use. 

#### Why class based?
class based battles give a unique flair to games and allow more customization, allowing for the player to develop their own fighting style with whichever class they chose, allowing for more people to get into the game as there is more variety in playing styles, potentially you could have long ranged battles, or closer ranged, and you would have the added challange of countering a long range class with a short range class or vice versa. this allows for a lot more freedom in battles making the game have more variety. 

#### More on the insparation
My main insparation was Team fortress 2's class system which allows you to play as 9 different classes of fighter, each doing a variety of things different with their own different perks and disadvantages, for instance if you play as a class like The Heavy you have a big gun and lots of health points, but reduce movement speed and lowered jump height making you more vulnerable for a class such as The Scout which has faster movement speed but does lower damage and has lower health points.

#### Weapon Unlocks
We could potentially add a system of unlocking weapons, for instance having the game give you a better sword or gun after X amount of victories, encouraging players to play the game more. It's very important to balace this system so that a new player is not completely overpowered by a long-time player, but still providing motivation to unlock new weapons and items.

#### Level ideas
Ideally the levels would have elevation changes, and potentially in the future the ability to go inside of a building to hide. a good map design would have the players start out on opposite ends of the map, and have visial differences in the map but no actual mechanical differences, providing a visually interesting, but level playing field.

#### Goals & Gamemodes
The game would ideally have a goal to it, such as capturing points to progress levels, or a simpler capture the flag mode in which you need to recover an item from an enemy base. these two modes as a basis could open possibilities for a wide variety of modes, such as an attack/defend mode in which only one team has the capture point or the flag, and is defending it, and when the enemy team captures it the role can switch and now the enemy is defending. we could make other variants of these modes with, say only melee weapons, or no health point regeneration. This shows my point that establishing two base modes allows for a wide variety of modes based off of these two in the future with relatively little change.
