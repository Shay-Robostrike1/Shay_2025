### RPG Idea
Since We don't exactly know what We want our RPG to be about, We'll start off by listing thing we want to include:

Plot/ Main Quest
NPC's you can interact with, whether it is just having a nice talk, receiving a hint or getting power-up
Decision making: since this is an RPG I'd like the player to be able to make different decisions that influence the ending of the game. I think it would probably be good about 2 decisions the player has to make (ex: Pick a or b, but 2 times), because that way the player is engaged in the game and there is a variety of possibilities for the different endings. On top of that I think maybe it would be easier to start off with a less complex story. (Of course, if this is too much work I could lower it down to 1 decision)
I'd the game to be more gameplay oriented while still keeping a plot that the player has to follow. Like for example, puzzles, battles and mini games along the story.
If there is extra time left, I'd like to include some funny secrets and mini side stories, since I believe it's a really fun to search for them (THIS IS JUST AN EXTRA; MEANING THAT IF THERE IS NO TIME LEFT, THIS PART WILL GET SKIPPED)
